Consider an ROC Curve.
Consider a Gains Curve.
Important variables have low variance. Examine distributions of variables.
"Regression just doesnâ€™t decompose variance in a way that provides straightforward answers to such questions" as, "What variables are most important?".
Consider https://github.com/online-ml/river for training a Bayesian model on a data frame with 1,024 columns related to folded sums of number of occurrences of substructures.
Consider multiple values of each parameter according to Stochastic Gradient Descent.
Consider increasing number of draws, reducing number of descriptors, and examining distributions.
A Bayesian Linear Regression model seems to predict docking scores corresponding to observations with extreme docking scores better than a Bayesian model with a BART model.
A Bayesian model with a BART model seems to predict docking scores corresponding to observations with docking scores within one standard deviation of a mean better than a Bayesian Linear Regression model.
Our goal is to maximize the height of the left most bars in an Enrichment Factor Plot and improve the correlation of predicted and observed docking scores.
Consider developing and ensemble of a Random-Forest model and a Linear-Regression model.
Consider developing BART model.
Consider using all descriptors or different subsets of descriptors.
Consider comparing Enrichment-Factor plots for training and test sets.
